# 100 Days of Backend Engineering with Python and Django

Welcome to my "100 Days of Code" challenge repository, where I document my journey in becoming a skilled backend software engineer using Python and Django.

## About the Challenge

The "100 Days of Code" challenge is an intensive learning journey where I commit to coding and learning backend engineering concepts for 100 consecutive days. This challenge aims to enhance my skills, deepen my understanding of Python and Django, and build real-world projects.

## Repository Structure

- **Projects:** This directory contains the projects I work on during the challenge. Each project will bein the folder for that specific day.
- **Logs:** In this directory, you'll find my daily progress logs, documenting the concepts I've learned, challenges I've faced, and the code I've written throughout the challenge.


## Progress Tracking

To track my progress throughout the challenge, I'll be updating the main README file with links to each day's progress log. This will help me stay accountable and provide a comprehensive overview of my journey.

## Support and Feedback

I welcome any feedback, suggestions, or questions you may have about the code or projects in this repository. Feel free to open issues or reach out to me through the provided contact information.

Let's embark on this exciting journey together and become skilled backend software engineers with Python and Django!

Happy coding!
